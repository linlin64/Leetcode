Algorithm:
I would set 2 pointers: left pointer and right pointer which started from the endpoints of arrays.Then, we will sum two pointers' values and
compared with target value. Then if sum is smaller than the target, I would increse the left pointers. If sum is bigger than the trarget, I would decrease 
the right pointers. If we found sum is euqal to target, we will found the pair and output their positions.

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int left=0;
        int right=numbers.length-1;
        //System.out.println(right);
        while(left<right)
        {
            int sum=numbers[left]+numbers[right];
            if(sum<target)
            {
                left++;
            }
            else if(sum>target)
            {
                right--;
            }
            else
            {
               left++;
               right++;
               break;
            }
        }

        // int[] result= new int[2];
        // result[0]=left;
        // result[1]=right;
        return new int[] {left,right};
    }
}
